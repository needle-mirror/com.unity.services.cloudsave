    "changelog": "### Changed\n* All existing methods have been marked as obsolete. They have mostly been replicated in new namespaces with some additional changes:\n  * Methods in the namespace `CloudSaveService.Instance.Files` have been replicated in the namespace `CloudSaveService.Instance.Files.Player` without additional changes.\n  * Methods in the namespace `CloudSaveService.Instance.Data` have been replicated in the namespace `CloudSaveService.Instance.Data.Player` with some additional changes:\n    * `RetrieveAllKeysAsync` has been renamed to `ListAllKeysAsync` and now returns a `Task<List<ItemKey>>` where `ItemKey` includes additional metadata alongside the key: The write lock value, and modified date-time.\n    * `LoadAsync` and `LoadAllAsync` now return a `Task<Dictionary<string, Item>>`, where `Item` includes additional metadata alongside the value: The write lock value, modified date-time, and created date-time.\n    * `ForceSaveAsync` has been removed in favour of `SaveAsync(IDictionary<string, object> data)`, or `SaveAsync(IDictionary<string, SaveItem> data)` without specifying the write lock on the `SaveItem`.\n    * `ForceDeleteAsync` has been removed in favour of `DeleteAsync` without specifying the write lock option.\n\n### Added\n* Support for reading data from custom IDs stored with Game State for Cloud Save Data. This data is read-only from the SDK and the following methods are available from the namespace `CloudSaveService.Instance.Data.Custom.*`\n  * `ListAllKeysAsync` will list all keys for a given custom data ID with their metadata\n  * `LoadAsync` will load the data for the specified keys for a given custom data ID\n  * `LoadAllAsync` will load all the data for a given custom data ID\n* Support for reading and enforcing write locks on player data writes:\n  * Added `SaveAsync(IDictionary<string, SaveItem> data)` which will fail for the given item if the supplied write lock on the `SaveItem` does not match the server state\n  * `SaveAsync` returns a `Dictionary<string, string>` with the saved keys and their updated write locks\n  * Added `DeleteAsync` with an optional `DeleteOptions` parameter which will fail if the specified write lock option does not match the server state"
